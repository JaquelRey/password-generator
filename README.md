## Authors

The html and css for this project were supplied by my instructor (Ross Ritchey with Trilogy Education) as part of the program. I wrote the javascript to make the app functional.

## Acknowledgments

This was one of the first projects we worked on as an introduction to javascript. In addition to w3schools, MDN, and stackoverflow, I used this page https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters to learn what special characters I could use in a password.
